        The Warren College Student Council (WCSC) is the democratically elected body dedicated to representing 
        the interests and well-being of every Warren College student at the University of California, San Diego.
        Rooted in a commitment to inclusive engagement, the council works closely with college and university 
        administrators to advocate for policies and resources that enhance academic experiences, campus life, and 
        student services. Through regular dialogue with constituents—via open meetings, surveys, and direct 
        outreach—WCSC ensures that student voices are heard on issues ranging from housing and dining to 
        mental health support and sustainability initiatives.
