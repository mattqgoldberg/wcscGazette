# Warren Passes AAPI Heritage Month Resolution, Awaits Broader Approval

At its May 12, 2025 meeting, the Warren College Student Council (WCSC) unanimously passed a resolution celebrating Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. The resolution now awaits consideration and passage by the Associated Students Senate and the other UCSD College Councils.

The resolution, introduced by AS Senator Sitanggang and co-sponsored by Vice President External Cole, formally recognizes May as Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month and celebrates the contributions of AAPI communities to American culture, history, and growth.

## Resolution Details

The resolution acknowledges the rich diversity of AAPI cultures, languages, and traditions while also recognizing the historic and contemporary hardships faced by these communities—including the Chinese Exclusion Act, Japanese American internment during World War II, and recent anti-Asian sentiment and violence.
