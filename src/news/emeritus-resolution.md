# Resolution Awards Posthumous President Emeritus Status to Erik Ward

In the May 12, 2025 meeting, a resolution to posthumously honor Warren College alumnus Erik Ward with the title of President Emeritus was passed unanimously by the Warren College Student Council.

The resolution, introduced by Vice President External Cole and co-sponsored by AS Senator Sitanggang, formally recognizes Ward's significant contributions to Warren College and establishes a lasting commemoration of his legacy.

## Resolution Details

The resolution honors Erik Ward, who graduated Cum Laude from Warren College in 2007. During his time at UCSD, Ward was deeply involved in college governance, serving as Freshman Senator, Commuter At-Large, and as the 2004-05 Warren College Student Council President.

Notably, Ward was recognized as the visionary creator of the Warren Transfer and Commuter Commission (WTCC), which continues to enhance representation and support for transfer and commuter students at Warren College to this day.

Tragically, Erik Ward passed away in 2019 at the age of 33 following an accident.
