# Daniel T. Watts Awarded President Emeritus Status Despite Never Serving as President

In the May 12, 2025 meeting, a resolution to honor former Warren College student Daniel T. Watts with the title of President Emeritus was passed unanimously by the Warren College Student Council. This unusual recognition comes despite Watts never having officially served as Council President.

The resolution, introduced by Vice President External Cole and co-sponsored by AS Senator Sitanggang, recognizes Watts' significant contributions to Warren College and addresses a contested election from over two decades ago.

## Resolution Details

Daniel T. Watts attended Warren College from 2001-2006 and was deeply involved in campus politics. The resolution acknowledges that Watts actually won the 2003-04 Warren College Student Council presidential election with 314 votes to Tim Alexander's 227 votes.

However, Watts never assumed the presidency due to a complex series of events involving a Judicial Board case filed by Warren College alum Crystal Kitamura regarding Watts' campaigning for the presidency on his Warren College Television program, "Perfect Vision."

## A Complicated History

The resolution outlines the sequence of events:
- The Judicial Board initially disqualified Watts from the presidency on April 18, 2003
- Warren College Student Council President Donald Povieng overturned this decision on April 30, 2003, reinstating Watts as president-elect
- On May 1, 2003, the WCSC voted unanimously to overturn Povieng's decision, upholding the Judicial Board's disqualification
- Tim Alexander ultimately served as the Council's 2003-04 President

The resolution specifically notes that "Watts' campaigning activities were protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution," suggesting the original disqualification may have been improper.

The full text of the resolution states:

> WHEREAS, Daniel T. Watts is a UC San Diego alumnus, attending Warren College from 2001-2006;
>
> AND WHEREAS, during this time Watts was incredibly active in both student government and state politicsâ€“serving on the Warren College Student Council Judicial Board, running for the Presidency of the Warren College Student Council, running twice for the Presidency of the Associated Students at UC San Diego, and having sought the governorship of California in the 2003 recall election whilst still an active student;
>
> AND WHEREAS, Daniel T. Watts received 314 popular votes to Tim Alexander's 227 from the Warren College Student Body in the 2003-04 Warren College Student Council presidential election;
>
> AND WHEREAS, Watts never served as Warren College Student Council President due to a case in the Judicial Board filed by Warren College alum Crystal Kitamura in regards to Watts' campaigning for the presidency on his Warren College Television program, "Perfect Vision";
>
> AND WHEREAS, the case initially disqualified Watts from the presidency on April 18, 2003;
>
> AND WHEREAS, Warren College Student Council President Donald Povieng subsequently overturned the decision by the Judicial Board on April 30, 2003, reinstating Watts as president-elect;
>
> AND WHEREAS, on May 1, 2003, the WCSC voted unanimously to overturn Povieng's decision, upholding the Judicial Board's disqualification of Watts, with Alexander serving as the Council's 2003-04 President;
>
> AND WHEREAS, Watts' campaigning activities were protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution;
>
> AND WHEREAS, we desire to make known our appreciation for Watts' work and contributions to the Warren College and UC San Diego at large;
>
> AND WHEREAS, we recognize that Watts continues to keep in contact with the activities of the UC San Diego Campus and the Warren College Community;
>
> THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we, the Legislative Council, do hereby authorize and direct the President of the Council to, as soon as it is convenient, confer the title, status, and honor of President Emeritus upon Daniel T. Watts via a Proclamation.

## Next Steps

The Warren College Student Council President will now prepare a formal Proclamation to confer the title of President Emeritus upon Daniel T. Watts. This unusual honor for someone who never officially served as president appears to be both a recognition of Watts' contributions to campus life and a symbolic redress of the contested 2003 election outcome.

Beyond his campus activities, the resolution notes that Watts also sought the governorship of California in the 2003 recall election while still an active student, highlighting his political ambitions that extended beyond campus.
