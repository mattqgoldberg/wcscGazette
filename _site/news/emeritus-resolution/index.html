    <h1>Resolution Awards Posthumous President Emeritus Status to Erik Ward</h1>
<p>In the May 12, 2025 meeting, a resolution to posthumously honor Warren College alumnus Erik Ward with the title of President Emeritus was passed unanimously by the Warren College Student Council.</p>
<p>The resolution, introduced by Vice President External Cole and co-sponsored by AS Senator Sitanggang, formally recognizes Ward's significant contributions to Warren College and establishes a lasting commemoration of his legacy.</p>
<h2>Resolution Details</h2>
<p>The resolution honors Erik Ward, who graduated Cum Laude from Warren College in 2007. During his time at UCSD, Ward was deeply involved in college governance, serving as Freshman Senator, Commuter At-Large, and as the 2004-05 Warren College Student Council President.</p>
<p>Notably, Ward was recognized as the visionary creator of the Warren Transfer and Commuter Commission (WTCC), which continues to enhance representation and support for transfer and commuter students at Warren College to this day.</p>
<p>Tragically, Erik Ward passed away in 2019 at the age of 33 following an accident.</p>
<p>The full text of the resolution states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WHEREAS, Erik Ward was a UC San Diego alumnus, graduating Cum Laude from Warren College in 2007;</p>
<p>AND WHEREAS, during this time Ward was incredibly active in Warren College Affairs having served as Freshman Senator, Commuter At-Large, and as the 2004-05 Warren College Student Council President;</p>

<p>AND WHEREAS, we desire to make known our appreciation for Ward's work and contributions to the Warren College and commemorate Ward's legacy for eternity;</p>
<p>THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we, the Legislative Council, do hereby authorize and direct the President of the Council to, as soon as it is convenient, confer the title, status, and honor of President Emeritus posthumously upon Erik Ward via a Proclamation, commemorating his contributions and dedication to the Warren College community.</p>
