    <h1>Resolution Celebrating AAPI Heritage Month Passes Unanimously</h1>
<p>In the May 12, 2025 meeting, a resolution celebrating Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month was passed unanimously by the Associated Students Senate and College Councils.</p>
<p>The resolution, introduced by AS Senator Sitanggang and co-sponsored by Vice President External Cole, formally recognizes May as Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month and celebrates the contributions of AAPI communities to American culture, history, and growth.</p>
<h2>Resolution Details</h2>
<p>The resolution acknowledges the rich diversity of AAPI cultures, languages, and traditions while also recognizing the historic and contemporary hardships faced by these communities—including the Chinese Exclusion Act, Japanese American internment during World War II, and recent anti-Asian sentiment and violence.</p>
<p>The full text of the resolution states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE ASSOCIATED STUDENTS SENATE AND THE COLLEGE COUNCILS
Celebration of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month 2025</p>
<p>WHEREAS, May is officially recognized as Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month;</p>
<p>AND WHEREAS, it is our desire to join in the commemoration of the contributions made by the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities to the culture, history, and growth of the United States;</p>
<p>AND WHEREAS, we recognize and appreciate the rich diversity of cultures, languages, and traditions from across all of the AAPI communities;</p>
<p>AND WHEREAS, we acknowledge the significant progress and ongoing contributions of AAPI communities, made in the face of historic and contemporary hardships—including the injustices of the Chinese Exclusion Act, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, and the recent resurgence of anti-Asian sentiment and violence;</p>
<p>AND WHEREAS, we maintain our cognizance of the impacts that the American colonial past has had upon AAPI communities and their forebears:</p>
<p>THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we, the ASUCSD Senate and the UCSD College Councils, do join together to formally celebrate this year's Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month;</p>
<p>AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we do collectively honor the invaluable contributions of AAPI communities and stand in solidarity with them in the face of the unjust prejudices they have previously and do continue to face;</p>
<p>AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we do authorize and direct the respective officers responsible for public communications within the individual College Councils and the Associated Students to make this Resolution available for public consumption upon its adoption by the Associated Students Senate.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>The resolution directs public communications officers from each College Council and the Associated Students to make this resolution publicly available. Warren College Student Council is proud to share this resolution with the Warren College community as part of our commitment to celebrating diversity and inclusion on campus.</p>
